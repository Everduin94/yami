flash-cards in Yami are separated by categories. Categories allow users to organize related cards together or create sizable groups to practice at a time. Categories can be whatever the user wants them to be, and used in any way that suits their needs.

Show Answer will display the answer of the currently selected question. If the answer has a fill-in-the-blank, the corresponding answers will be marked green (correct) or red (incorrect). -- Yami will check if an answer is correct or incorrect whenever an answer changes. To update an answer simply type in the type in the text field and then hit Tab; there's no need to hide and show the answer to reset.

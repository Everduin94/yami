Yami is a web application designed for creating flash-cards using Markdown. It's a way to create, store, and practice with highly customizable flash-cards. Each flash-card is composed of a title, category, question, and answer. This allows the user to quickly identify, filter, and customize their cards.

Yami gives users the ability to create Fill in the Blanks within their flash-cards. This allows users to practice by typing answers and getting feedback on whether the answer was right or wrong.

Flash-cards can be simple, or intricate and descriptive. Images, GIFs, and syntax highlighting for code snippets are all possible using Yami. See the "What is Markdown" section for more information!
